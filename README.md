## How does it work?
The indexer subscribes to newPendingTransaction and minedTransaction events of the node and process these events to identify their life cycle states - Queued, Pending, Confirmed, Failed, Cancelled.

## How are states identified

### Queued
Every transaction that enters the indexer via newPendingTransaction subscription are transactions added to the network to mempool. These are marked as Queued and stored in DB.

### Pending
Using transaction hash in the transaction processing module we fetch <code>getTransactionByHash</code> and <code>transactionReceipt</code>. If  <code>getTransactionByHash</code> reponse gives a null block number or <code>transactionReceipt</code> result is null then the transaction is picked up but not yet mined - Pending state

### Cancelled
If the <code>getTransactionByHash</code> result is null, the transaction is unknown - Cancelled state.

### Failed
If the <code>transactionReceipt</code> result status is **0x0** then the transaction is in Failed state.

### Confirmed
If the <code>transactionReceipt</code> result status is anything other than **0x0** then the transaction is in Confirmed state.
